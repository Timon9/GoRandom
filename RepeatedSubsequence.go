Given a string, check if a repeated subsequence is present in it or not. The repeated subsequence should have a length of 2 or more.

Input: "XYBAXB"
Output: true
Explanation: String "XYBAXB" has XB(XBXB) as a repeated subsequence

Input: "XBXAXB"
Output: true
Explanation: String "XBXAXB" has XX(XXX) as a repeated subsequence

Input: "XYBYAXBY"
Output: true
Explanation: String "XYBYAXBY" has XB(XBXB), XY(XYXY), YY(YYY), YB(YBYB), and YBY(YBYBY) as repeated subsequences.

Input: "ABCA"
Output: false
Explanation: String "ABCA" doesnâ€™t have any repeated subsequence
